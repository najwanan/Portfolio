# Portfolio
Summary: This is my first Dev Portfolio. 

## PURPOSE
This project served a dual purpose. It's a showcase for my own work, but I also wanted to explore creating an optimal template for all junior devs.
A template will be created for this project and made available for community use on my other github profile.
